                <h2>About Freddie Mercury</h2>
                <p>Freddie Mercury was a singer-songwriter and musician whose music reached the top of U.S. and British
                    charts in the 1970s and 1980s. As the frontman of Queen, Mercury was one of the most talented and
                    innovative singers of the rock era. Born Farrokh Bulsara in Tanzania, Mercury studied piano in
                    boarding school in India, then befriended numerous musicians at London's Ealing College of Art.
                    Mercury died of AIDS-related bronchial pneumonia on November 24, 1991, at age 45.</p>

                    <h2>Freddie Mercury's Teeth and Vocal Range</h2>
                    <p>Mercury was born with four extra teeth in the back of his mouth, causing his now-famous bucktooth
                        grin. In fact, his nickname growing up was Bucky. <br>
                        Mercury never got his teeth fixed because he was afraid it would ruin his impressive four-octave
                        vocal range.</p>

                    <h1>QUEEN</h1>
                    <p>Mercury met his future bandmates, drummer Roger Taylor and guitarist Brian May, around the time
                        he moved to London in the 1960s. They met up with bassist John Deacon in 1971. The quartet,
                        which Mercury dubbed Queen, played their first gig together that June. <br><br>
                        In 1973, Queen released their first album, titled Queen. They quickly followed up with their
                        second album, Queen II, in 1974, which they recorded in over just one month. The album was the
                        first taste of the group's signature harmonies and music styles, including ballads, folk, blues,
                        metal, pop and rock, and included the single "Seven Seas of Rhye."<br><br>
                        Before his death, Mercury worked in the studio with Queen. These efforts were released in 1995
                        on Made In Heaven, the group's last album with all the original members. Gone but clearly not
                        forgotten, this collection of Mercury's final performances reached the top of the British
                        charts. <br><br>
                        Mercury and Queen were recognized for their contributions to American music history when they
                        were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2001.
